The purpose of this project is to create tidy data set 

Here are the data for the project:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

This was the goal of the project:

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable 
for each activity and each subject.

Steps
1. Download and unzip file
2. Look at the data in the files
##Activity labels

##1 WALKING
##2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
##3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
##4 SITTING
##5 STANDING
##6 LAYING

The R code in run_analysis.R does the following:
1. Unzip Project Data to /data directory and check the file
2. check files in UCI HAR Dataset folder
3. check files in each "test" and "train" folders
4. create data frames for each set of data
5. read activity labels and features
6. View the data set, read the names
7. head(featuresData)
##V1                V2
##1  1 tBodyAcc-mean()-X
##2  2 tBodyAcc-mean()-Y
##3  3 tBodyAcc-mean()-Z
##4  4  tBodyAcc-std()-X
##5  5  tBodyAcc-std()-Y
##6  6  tBodyAcc-std()-Z

head(activityLabelsData)
##V1                 V2
##1  1            WALKING
##2  2   WALKING_UPSTAIRS
##3  3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
##4  4            SITTING
##5  5           STANDING
##6  6             LAYING
8. assign activity names
9. assign names to test set
10. assign names to train set
11. merging data in one data set and view merged data
12. we give descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
13. use grepl to identify necessary names (returns TRUE/FALSE vector)
14. extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
15. ## create second dataset using aggregate, then order it
## remember to use FinalDataNames, not the FinaldataMS
16. View results
17. write it as a txt file

Main component of worm is keep checking eveyr new data frame using View() function to undertand the data we are workign with

Variables used:
trainDataSubject, trainX, trainY, activityLabelsData, featuresData, mergedTest, mergedTrain, FinalData, FinalDataNames,
meanstd, FinalDataMS, SecondDataSet

Functions used:
grepl, merge, cbind, rbind, aggregate,
